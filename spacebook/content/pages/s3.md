Instead of a local configuration file, GLAuth can fetch its configuration from S3.  This is an easy way to ensure redundant GLAuth servers are always in-sync.
```unix
glauth -c s3://bucketname/glauth.cfg
```
In order to use S3, you must set your AWS credentials.  Either:

1. set the -K and -S command-line flags  **OR**
2. set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.

As of version _2.3.0_, S3-compatible providers, such as Backblaze V2, are supported.

To specify a custom endpoint, provide this argument:

```shell
--aws_endpoint_url <url>
```
